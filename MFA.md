### **Summary from the Additional Link (https://sallam.gitbook.io/sec-88/web-appsec/features-abuse/2fa)**

#### **1. 2FA Bypass Testing Methods**
- **Reusing the Code**: Try reusing a previously sent 2FA code.
- **State Change**: Change the user’s state (e.g., disable 2FA) after login.
- **Bypassing Verification**: Attempt to bypass the verification page by manipulating requests.
- **Time Manipulation**: Try extending the validity period of the 2FA code or resending it.
- **Protocol Exploitation**: Exploit vulnerabilities in protocols like OAuth or SAML.

#### **2. Common Techniques**
- **Response Manipulation**: Modify server responses to bypass 2FA.
- **Parameter Tampering**: Alter parameters in requests to skip 2FA.
- **Brute Force**: Attempt to brute-force 2FA codes (if rate limits are weak).

- **OAuth Toolkit**: For testing OAuth implementations.
- **Custom Scripts**: To automate testing of 2FA bypass techniques.
